I just received my PhD in Computer Science in May 2024 at [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). Starting in fall 2024, I will be a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard's Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS), hosted by Ariel Procaccia. After that, I am excited to be joining the University of British Columbia as an assistant professor in computer science. 

I have also concurrently worked with [Google Research](https://research.google/people/SerenaLutongWang/) at 20% time for the last six years, where I have had the privilege of working with amazing mentors including [Ravi Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/ravik53/), [Preston McAfee](https://mc4f.ee/), and [Maya Gupta](https://mayagupta.org/). My PhD research was supported by the Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

My research focuses on understanding and improving the long term societal impacts of machine learning by rethinking ML algorithms and their surrounding incentives and practices. I'm particularly interested in gaps between metrics and goals, and how those gaps may be bridged through algorithmic improvements, analysis of multi-agent incentives and interdependence, and better understanding of intervention context. I employ tools from machine learning, robust optimization, causal inference, and most recently, economics.
