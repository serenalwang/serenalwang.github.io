# Serena L. Wang 

<img src="img/serena.jpg" alt="Photo" class="rightside_image">

I am a fifth-year PhD student in Computer Science at [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Rediet Abebe](https://www.redietabebe.com/) and [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). I am generously supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD fellowship. I have also concurrently held a 20% collaboration with [Google Research](https://research.google/people/SerenaLutongWang/) for the last six years, where I am part of the Discrete Algorithms Group and have also worked with [Maya Gupta](https://mayagupta.org/) on the [Glassbox Machine Learning Research team](https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/11/05/165175/google-tries-to-make-machine-learning-a-little-more-human/) on making machine learning models more interpretable and controllable using constrained optimization.

My research focuses on understanding and improving the long term societal impacts of machine learning by rethinking ML algorithms and their surrounding incentives and practices. On the algorithmic side, I employ tools from robust optimization, constrained optimization, and statistical learning theory.
