I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I am also a part time software engineer at [Google Research](https://research.google/people/SerenaLutongWang/), having been a full time member of the [Glassbox Machine Learning Research team](https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/11/05/165175/google-tries-to-make-machine-learning-a-little-more-human/) with [Maya Gupta](https://mayagupta.org/) for 2 years. I received a B.A. in Computer Science from Harvard University in 2016.

My research interests include developing machine learning algorithms that are fair and robust in practically meaningful ways, employing tools from constrained optimization and statistical learning theory.

This year I am co-president of UC Berkeley's Women in Computer Science and Engineering ([WICSE](https://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~wicse/)).
