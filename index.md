# Serena L. Wang 

<img src="img/serena.jpg" alt="Photo" class="rightside_image">

I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). I am generously supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD fellowship. I have also concurrently worked at [Google Research](https://research.google/people/SerenaLutongWang/) at 20% time for the last six years, where I am part of the Discrete Algorithms Group with [Ravi Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/ravik53/) and previously worked with [Maya Gupta](https://mayagupta.org/).

My research focuses on understanding and improving the long term societal impacts of machine learning by rethinking ML algorithms and their surrounding incentives and practices. I'm particularly interested in gaps between metrics and goals, and how those gaps may be bridged through algorithmic improvements, analysis of multi-agent incentives and interdependence, and better understanding of intervention context. I employ tools from machine learning, robust optimization, causal inference, and most recently, economics.
